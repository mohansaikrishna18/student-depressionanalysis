Overview
This Flask web application allows users to search for student depression status by their name (supports partial and case-insensitive search). It displays student details along with their depression status, recommended medicines, and practical suggestions to reduce depression.

The app uses a dataset CSV file students_depression_clean.csv containing student mental health data.
